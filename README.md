# Design-Portfolio

A collection of my Graphic Design and UX Design work.

## 3D Renders

Build and rendered using Cinema4D, experimenting with lighting and colors. I've kept the designs simple, with few textures, relying on geometry to show the designs.

## Pixelated Game Elements

Built in pygame, this was a demo of a game build with pixelated tetures. Im happy with how the corgi and the buildings turned out.

## ASCII Art

Nothing says you're a hacker like some sweet ASCII art. I always enjoyed making it and I find it makes CLI applications that bit more human friendly.

## Company Design Guides

In an experiment to teach myself company design guidelines and how you can use them I wrote an example guide here. I really like the 3D effect on the buttons.

## Interfaces

Ive always enjoyed designing interfaces, weither they are real or fake, the humans interact with software has always intrigued me. Here is a short collection of some of the interface design and web work I have made.

## Logo Design

Logo design probably isnt my strong suite, but thats just more reason to practise. These are all made with Photoshop or Illustrator.
